Skin is based on NerubianUI, made by [unwirklich](https://www.deviantart.com/unwirklich/art/Nerubian-Interface-189419574), for Warcraft 3.
All credits for the art i used to make this skin should go to him. I own none of it and will remove this if promted.

# Installation
- Download [WIIIUI Addon](https://github.com/Fiurs-Hearth/WIIIUI), using the link above, and install it;
- Click on the green "Code" button up top and choose "Download Zip";
- Download and unpack the archive. Find **custom2** folder inside.
- Move the **custom2** folder in to **\World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\WIIIUI\art**;
- Open addon menu in game and click on the **Custom2** button to apply it;
 
In case you already have custom skins installed - change folder's name from **custom2** to **custom#**, where **#** is a number from 2-8, which is not currently used.
 
Feel free to bash me for leaving some unfinished stuff here and there. 
 
# Known issues:
- the long middle bar is a bit wonky - its just is. Sorry.
- there is a gap between the Lid and most right side of the chat-field. No idea why.
- the whole thing is a bit low res. The base i used was low quality, ill try to make it better later.
